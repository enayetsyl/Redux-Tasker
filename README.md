 ## About the Project

 
### Introduction:

This application is a Todo list manager built using React and Redux. It allows users to add new todos, mark todos as complete/incomplete, and remove todos. The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface for managing tasks efficiently.

### Tech Used:

- React: Used for building the user interface and managing component states.

- Redux Toolkit: Used for state management, including actions, reducers, and the Redux store.

- React-Toastify: Used for displaying toast notifications for various actions.

- Framer Motion: Used for adding animations to buttons.

### Code Logic:

- Redux State Management: Todos are managed in the Redux store, allowing for global access and modification across components.

- LocalStorage Integration: Todos are persisted in the browser's local storage, ensuring data persistence between sessions.

- Dynamic Text Resizing: The Header component dynamically adjusts its text size based on the container width, ensuring optimal presentation across different screen sizes.

- Button Animation: The Button component employs animations to provide visual feedback when hovered over or clicked.

### Code Design:

- Component-Based Architecture: The application is structured into reusable components such as Header, AddTodo, TodoList, and Button, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- CSS Styling: Tailwind CSS is used for styling components, providing a modern and responsive design.

- Separation of Concerns: Each component focuses on a specific aspect of the application's functionality, enhancing readability and ease of maintenance.

### Code Functionality:

- Adding Todos: Users can input new todos via the AddTodo component, with validation to prevent empty entries.

- Completing Todos: Todos can be marked as complete or incomplete by clicking the appropriate button in the TodoList component.

- Removing Todos: Users can delete individual todos by clicking the delete button associated with each todo.

- Toast Notifications: Toast notifications are displayed to provide feedback for todo-related actions, enhancing the user experience.

### Conclusion:

In conclusion, this Todo list application demonstrates effective use of React and Redux for state management, along with additional libraries for enhanced functionality and user experience. The application provides a simple yet powerful tool for managing tasks efficiently, with features such as dynamic text resizing and animated buttons contributing to its usability and appeal. With its clean codebase and intuitive design, the application serves as a solid foundation for further expansion and customization to meet specific requirements and preferences.
